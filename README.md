### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jasper, I am a 19-year-old computer science student at Vancouver Island University with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer.

Currently, my biggest interest is webpage development, and hence I am most often programming in JavaScript or Python. Although I also do have experience working with C++ and VBA.

When I'm not programming, I'm most likely out exploring the beauty Vancouver Island has to offer, playing my synthesizer, or playing recreational soccer.
