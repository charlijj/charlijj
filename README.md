## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Jasper and I'm a computer science student at Vancouver Island University. I have a passion for creating new things and enjoy seeing projects come to life. I specialize in web programming and am experienced with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap), PHP, and SQL. Additionally, I have experience in general programming languages such as C++, Python, and scripting with Bash.
<br/>
My skills don't just stop at programming - I am experienced in Linux system creation and maintenance (client/server) and have a solid understanding of the OSI model and networks. I also have experience working with API's and REST API's.
<br/>
When I'm not programming, you can find me exploring the beauty of Vancouver Island, playing my synthesizer, or playing recreational soccer.
<br/>
Feel free to check out my repositories and stars to see some of the projects I've worked on.
