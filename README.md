## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br/>
Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Jasper and I'm a computer science student at Vancouver Island University. I have a passion for creating new things and enjoy seeing projects come to life. Feel free to check out my repositories and stars to see some of the projects I've worked on.
When I'm not programming, you can find me exploring the beauty of Vancouver Island, playing my synthesizer, or playing recreational soccer.
