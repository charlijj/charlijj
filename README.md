## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Jasper and I'm a computer science student at Vancouver Island University. I have a passion for creating new things and enjoy seeing projects come to life. I specialize in web programming and am expirenced with HTML5, CSS, Javascript(jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap), PHP, and SQL. Additionally, I have experience in general programming languages such as C++, Python, and scripting with Bash.

My skills don't just stop at programming - I am experienced in Linux system creation and maintenance (client/server) and have a solid understinding of the OSI model and networks. I also have experience working with API's and REST API's.

When I'm not programming, you can find me exploring the beauty of Vancouver Island, playing my synthesizer, or playing recreational soccer.

Feel free to check out my GitHub to see some of the projects I've worked on.
